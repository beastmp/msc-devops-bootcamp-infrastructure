# DevOps Bootcamp - Infrastructure

> This repository contains the infrastructure code for the CloudMart e-commerce platform, developed as part of the DevOps Bootcamp project.

## Background

The DevOps Bootcamp Infrastructure project provides the foundation for a modern cloud-native e-commerce application. It was created to demonstrate best practices in infrastructure as code, cloud resource management, and DevOps workflows. This infrastructure layer supports the deployment of frontend, backend, and Kubernetes components in a cohesive, scalable architecture.

## Approach

Using Terraform as the primary infrastructure as code tool, this project creates and manages AWS resources required by the CloudMart application. The approach follows modular design principles, with infrastructure components organized into logical modules:

- **Compute resources**: EC2 instances and EKS clusters for running application workloads
- **Container registry**: ECR repositories for storing Docker images
- **CI/CD pipelines**: CodePipeline configurations for automated deployments
- **Security**: IAM roles and policies for secure resource access
- **Storage**: DynamoDB tables and S3 buckets for data persistence

The project includes comprehensive documentation for each day of the bootcamp journey, guiding learners from basic infrastructure setup to advanced multi-cloud deployments.

## Results

The infrastructure project successfully provides:

1. A complete foundation for running the CloudMart e-commerce application
2. Reusable Terraform modules for common infrastructure patterns
3. Step-by-step tutorials demonstrating infrastructure deployment
4. Integration with CI/CD workflows for automated updates
5. Support for multi-cloud operations with AWS, GCP, and Azure

By implementing infrastructure as code practices, the project enables consistent, repeatable deployments and simplifies collaboration across development and operations teams.

## Next Steps

Future plans for this infrastructure project include:

- Adding monitoring and observability components
- Implementing cost optimization strategies
- Enhancing security with additional compliance controls
- Supporting blue/green deployment strategies
- Expanding multi-cloud capabilities with Kubernetes federation
